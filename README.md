The Gesture-Controlled 4-Wheeled Car is an innovative project that enables a 4-wheeled car to be operated using hand gestures. Utilizing a camera for gesture recognition and a set of battery-operated motors for movement, this project integrates computer vision and motor control technologies to create an interactive and fun vehicle.

Features

	•	Gesture Recognition: Real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
	•	Motor Control: Precise control of four battery-operated motors for driving the car forward, backward, left, and right.
	•	Wireless Communication: Communication between gesture recognition and motor control systems.

Components

	•	Camera Module: USB webcam or Raspberry Pi camera
	•	4-Wheeled Chassis: Custom or pre-made chassis for the car
	•	Motors: Four battery-operated motors with motor drivers
	•	Microcontroller/Single-Board Computer: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or similar
	•	Battery Pack: Adequate power supply for motors and electronics
	•	Motor Drivers: To interface with the motors and control their operation
